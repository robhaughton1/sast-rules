# SAST Rules

A collection of custom Semgrep rules designed to detect insecure patterns in JavaScript and Node.js applications. This repository serves as a personal static analysis lab where I practice writing rules, understanding vulnerability patterns, and building foundational SAST intuition.

## Running the Rules

Install Semgrep:

    pip install semgrep

Run all rules in this repository:

    semgrep --config ./semgrep-rules .
